Steps for Lunges:
Stand straight with your feet aligned with your hips. This is the starting position.
Engage your core, take a deep breath, and take a step forward with your left foot and kneel until your right knee is perpendicular to the ground.
Push back on your heel to lift back your body to the starting position.
Repeat this 20 times on each side. For best results, do this exercise while holding some weights.
Target Muscles: Glutes and buttocks, Hamstrings, Quadriceps, and Core muscles.
Precaution: While kneeling down, your knee should not cross your big toe as it may hurt your knees. Do not lean forward while doing lunges. Keep your upper body straight.
