Steps for Jumping Jacks:
Straight as a stick!
Hands up!
Feet’s apart!
Back to your roots
Now return back to the same position from where you have started. The straight part, with shoulders straight and arms at your side.
Tips: keep your tummy pulled back while inhaling and release while exhaling,  trimming up your fit and gist tummy. Be sure you tense your core muscles, or else your pain will be gone vain.
Precautions:While doing, you have to inhale in the starting position and exhale while spreading your legs.
