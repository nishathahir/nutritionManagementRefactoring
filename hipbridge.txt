Steps for Hip-Bridge:
Start lying flat on your back, your knees bent and your arms in low V by your hips. 

Your feet should be about hip-distance apart with your heels a few inches away from your butt.

Push through your heels to lift your hips up while squeezing your glutes. 

Try to create one diagonal line from your shoulders to your knees.

Pause for 1-2 seconds, then lower back down. 

That's 1 rep, do 10. Repeat for 3 sets total.
